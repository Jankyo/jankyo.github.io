		<h3>Knowing about your solar systems planets is nice, but you should get to 
		know more about the star responsible for keeping it intact!
		</h3>
		<p>
		With a diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers, 
		the sun's gravity of 274m/s<sup>2</sup>, combined with a mass of 
		1,988,500·10<sup>24</sup>kg, holds the entirety of our solar system together.
		To put this in perspective, here's a small table with a comparison to Earth.
		</p>
		<table class="sun-table">
			<tr>
				<th>Sun</th>
				<th>Earth</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<ul>
						<li>Diameter: ~1,400,000km</li>
						<li>Mass: 1,988,500·10<sup>24</sup>kg</li>
						<li>Gravity: 274m/s<sup>2</sup></li>
					</ul>
				</td>
				<td>
					<ul>
						<li>Diameter: 12,756km</li>
						<li>Mass: 5.97·10<sup>24</sup>kg</li>
						<li>Gravity: 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup></li>
					</ul>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			Despite the combined weight of everything else in our solar system, the sun makes up 
			about 99.8% of our systems mass.
			Even with these wopping stats, the sun is only about average size
			for a star.
		</p>
		<br></br>
		<p>
			The sun's lifespan is estimated to be about 10 billion years long, 
			with just over 5 billion of those years left. Once it nears the end, it will
			expand into a Red Giant, and swallow up Mercury, Venus, and potentially Earth as well.
			Once its fuel runs out however, it will shrink into a White Dwarf, 
			void of any atoms that can fuse to further provide energy.
		</p>
		<br></br>

		Lastly of course is the temperatures of the Sun. On It's surface, 
		the Sun reaches temperatures of 
		5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 Fahrenheit), hot enough to boil diamonds. 
		Beyond the surface, and just past the Suns atmosphere we reach the Corona.
		This zone is the Sun's outer atmosphere, which reaches temperatures of 2 
		million degrees Celsius (3.5 million Fahrenheit).
		At it's hottest, the core, 
		nuclear reactions occur constantly and heat the core up to 15 million degrees Celsius 
		(27 million Fahrenheit).
